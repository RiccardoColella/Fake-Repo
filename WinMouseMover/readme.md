# Windows Automatic MouseMover
for Winodows users only: run the powershell script into the folder to prevent your pc to go in standby.

It was born as a mouse mover, but the functionality didn't work. It currently press the `F5` button of the keyboard to prevent standby of your pc.

## How to run
If you don't know how to run the powershell script, simply double click on the `mousemover.bat` file.
